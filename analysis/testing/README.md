This folder contains scripts to plot key results to determine suitability of definitions before requesting the release of underlying data which will be used to create finalised plots of the same type. Within the `/functions` folder are a number of functions defined elsewhere in the repository which are necessary for these testing scripts and may have some changes to them for these purposes.
