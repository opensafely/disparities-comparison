**Dummy Data**

This folder contains the `.R` dummy data generation scripts and `arrow` dummy data files (kept within the `/data` folder). These can be used to run the pipeline locally when using `generate_dataset_` actions from the `.yaml` file. If additional variables are added to the `dataset_definition.py` script, then these must be added to the equivalent dummy data.
